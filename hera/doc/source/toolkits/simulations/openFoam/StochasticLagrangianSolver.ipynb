    "\n",
    "The Stochastic lagrangian solver extends the stochastic solver of OpenFOAM by adding a stochastic parameterization\n",
    "of the turbulence to the lagrangian solver. The solver uses the mean flow field that was prevsiouly computed to calculate\n",
    "the dispersion of lagrangian particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the solver interpolates the values of the mean fields both temporally and spatially (i.e to the location of the\n",
    "particle). Because the stochastic parametrization requires additional mean fields that are not solved by the\n",
    "navier solver (for example :math:`u_*`). However, adding those fields to the original solution of the flow field\n",
    "can be limiting when it is necessary to examine the effect of the parametrization on the dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, using the StochasticLagrangianSolver includes an intermediate step that creates a\n",
    "copy of the original flow field (**OFF**), but adds the required parametrization fields to it. To save space, the\n",
    "dispersion flow field (**DFF**) does not copy the mesh and the results, but rather, creates a symbolic links to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the DFF was created, it is possible to create the dispersion case. Since the StochasticLagrangianSolver required\n",
    "the configuration in numerous files (as is usual for openFOAM solvers), we use Hermes workflows to automate this procedure\n",
    "and convert JSON file to the configurations files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing dispersion workfows and other management can be achieved through the hera-workflows CLI."
