openFOAM Toolkit
================

Overview
--------

This toolkit manages the execution and analysis of openFOAM simulations in Hera.

To do so, each openFOAM solver has a dedicated toolkit that allows the users to
setup (using the hermes workflow) and analyze the simulation results.

The current solvers that are supported are:

- simpleFOAM
- :ref:`StochasticLagrangianSolver  <openFOAM_StochasticLagrangianSolver>`
