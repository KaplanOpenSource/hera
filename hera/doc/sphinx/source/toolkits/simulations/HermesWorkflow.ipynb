    "\n",
    "The Hermes workflow is designed to automate the creation of configuration files and the execution of files for running general applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each workflow is stored in JSON format. To execute a workflow, the JSON is translated into a Python program using the Hermes package.\n",
    "The Hermes-workflow toolkit manages the toolkits within a hera project.\n",
    "This toolkit enables users to add workflows to the project, check for the existence of a workflow based on its parameters, and compare different\n",
    "workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each workflow has a name, typically based on the name of the JSON workflow file, although this is not mandatory.\n",
    "Additionally, each workflow belongs to a simulation group (simulationGroup). The toolkit allows the users\n",
    "to simply compare the parameters of the different workflows within the group.\n",
    "Generally, the simulations are named [group name]_[group id]. However, users can choose names that do not follow this convention.\n",
    "The groups are defined dynamically, that is, if there is a workflow with a group defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolkit can be used as a library from code, or directly from a command-line interface (CLI). This CLI enables users to perform all operations conveniently."

    "Getting the workflow template can be achieved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building the workflow from scratch.\n",
    "1. Adjust an existing template manually\n",
    "1. Adjust an existing template using case configuration.\n",

    "\n",
    "The specialization of the workflow perfomed by setting the values of different parameters in the template\n",
    "to reflect the needs of the specific simulation. For example, in a template for wind calculation using OpenFOAM,\n",
    "the specialization is setting up the topography and the blockmesh (and possible the urban region, if needed).\n",
