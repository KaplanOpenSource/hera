    "Let's start with toolkits. A toolkit is a set of tools and functionalities tailored for specific areas and their data.  \n",
    "For example, the GIS Buildings toolkit is designed to work with Buildings data and includes functions for analyzing and managing this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following list includes the available toolkits Hera provides:  \n",
    "- Experiment toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Landcover toolkit\n",

    "- GIS Tiles toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Topography toolkit\n",

    "Each toolkit requires one or more datasources to function and operate. Each type of toolkit works with its corresponding data source type.  \n",

    "We will soon detail more about data sources in this notebook.\n",

    "### The Toolkit Structure\n",
    "Basically, each toolkit is designed as a 3-tier application. In simple words, each toolkit includes 3 layers:  \n",
    "1) **Data Layer**: Manages loading and parsing the specific data domain.  \n",
    "2) **Presentation Layer**: Manages the graphs and other types of presentation for the specific domain.  \n",
    "3) **Analysis Layer**: Manages the analysis and computational functions for the specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, users will mainly use the second and third layers.  \n",
    "It is important to note that while some toolkits may include only one or two of these layers, this is rare."

    "## Understanding the Role of JSON and Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hera, toolkits manage complex data, but they **do not inherently know** where the data is or how it is structured.  \n",
    "That's why we need a **JSON description** that instructs the toolkit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where the data file is located (`resource`).\n",
    "- What format the data is in (`dataFormat`).\n",
    "- How to interpret it (`desc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is JSON Necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolkit can't guess:\n",
    "- Which file to open.\n",
    "- Which library to use.\n",
    "- How to map the data fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON acts as a **contract** — a blueprint that tells the toolkit how to interact with the data properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where Does the Data Actually Come From?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Data Source** is the operational part that reads the JSON instructions and actually:\n",
    "- Opens the specified file.\n",
    "- Loads it using the correct handler (e.g., Rasterio, GeoPandas).\n",
    "- Parses it according to the given metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `resource` is missing or wrong, loading will fail!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an elevation file `/home/user/elevation/N33E035.hgt`,  \n",
    "the corresponding JSON would be:\n",
    "\n",

    "{\n",
    "    \"GIS_Topography\": {\n",
    "        \"DataSource\": {\n",

    "                    \"dataFormat\": \"rasterio\",\n",
    "                    \"desc\": {\n",
