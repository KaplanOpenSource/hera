    "The Hermes-workflow toolkit manages the toolkits within a hera project.\n",
    "This toolkit enables users to add workflows to the project, check for the existence of a workflow based on its parameters, and compare different\n",
    "workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each workflow has a name, typically based on the name of the JSON workflow file, although this is not mandatory.\n",
    "Additionally, each workflow belongs to a simulation group (simulationGroup). The toolkit allows the users\n",
    "to simply compare the parameters of the different workflows within the group.\n",
    "Generally, the simulations are named [group name]_[group id]. However, users can choose names that do not follow this convention.\n",
    "The groups are defined dynamically, that is, if there is a workflow with a group defined.\n",
    "\n",
