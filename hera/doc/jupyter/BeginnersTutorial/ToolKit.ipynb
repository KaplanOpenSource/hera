    "## Toolkits  \n",
    "Let's start with toolkits. Toolkits is a set of tools and functionalities tailored for specific areas and their data. For example, the GIS Building toolkit is designed to work with Buildings data and includes functions for analyzing and managing this type of data.  \n",
    "The following list includes the available toolkits the hera provides:  \n",
    "- Experiment toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Landcover toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Buildings toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Tiles toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Topography toolkit\n",
    "- GIS Demography toolkit\n",
    "- Meterology Low Frequency toolkit\n",
    "- Meterology High Frequency toolkit\n",
    "- Riskassessment Agents toolkit\n",
    "- Wind Profile toolkit\n",
    "- LSM toolkit\n",
    "- Open Foam toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each toolkit requires one or more datasources to function and operate. Each type of toolkit works with its corresponding data sources type. For example, the GIS Building toolkit works with a GIS Building Data source. The data sources are placed inside projects. We will soon detail more about data sources on in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Toolkit Structure\n",
    "Basicly, each toolkit is designed as a 3-tier application. In simple words, each of the toolkits include 3 layers:  \n",
    "1) **Data Layer**: Manages loading and parsing the specific data domain.\n",
    "2) **Presentation Layer**: Manages the graphs and other types of presentation for the specific domain.\n",
    "3) **Analysis Layer**: Manages the analysis and computational functions for the specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end,  users will mainly use the second and third layers.  \n",
    "It is important to note that while some toolkits may include only one of these layers, this is a rare occurrence."
