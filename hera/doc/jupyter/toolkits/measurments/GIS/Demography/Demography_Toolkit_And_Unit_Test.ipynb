    "\n",
    "### Core Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `loadData(...)`: Loads a shapefile or GeoJSON into the database as a population source.\n",
    "- `createNewArea(...)`: Generates a new area (polygon) and summarizes the intersecting population from a data source.\n",
    "- `calculatePopulationInPolygon(...)`: Calculates fractional population within a specified polygon.\n",
    "- `setDefaultDirectory(...)`: Sets and optionally creates a default directory to save shapefiles.\n"

    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Constructs a buffered rectangle around the first polygon.\n",

    "  - The result is not empty.\n",
