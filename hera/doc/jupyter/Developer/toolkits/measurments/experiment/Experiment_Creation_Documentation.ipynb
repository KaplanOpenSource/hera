    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, you should know that an experiment will be always connected to a certain or several Projects. \n",
    "You can read more about Projects [here](https://github.com/KaplanOpenSource/hera/blob/master/hera/doc/jupyter/datalayer/Project.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given only a zip file containing the metadata of an experiment, you can easily create it and connect it to a project, with a few simple comand lines(CLI) in your environment. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Experiment and Experiment ToolKit\n",
    "An **Experiment** is a simply folder that contains all the files related to an experiment, such as: the data of the devices, the metadata (which devices are in the experiment and etc.), the class of the experiment (will be explained soon) and other files. The **Experiment toolKit** is the interface which you can access that folder and perform actions and manipulations on it simply, and according to your requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why you should use it  \n",
    "#### Functions are already build for you\n",
    "The experiment toolkit is designed to handle experiments data and metadata inside projects. You can perform various actions with it. Instead of writing the code yourself, the tool already contains all functions you need.  \n",
    "#### Easy access to experiments\n",
    "It is also useful because it does not require you to remember where all experiments folders are. Inside a project, there may be a high number of experiments that you wish to reach, but you may not remember where their paths. The toolKit already holds the paths for you, so you can create as many experiments as you wish, without worrying about remembering their locations."

This class is meant for you to implement if you wish to write functions related to the experiment you are dealing with. You can also remain it empty. This class is also called the experiment class.\n",
