###high frequency
includes computation of turbulent quantities line mean(u'u'). Hence, we need sufficiently high sampling for it. I would say  10Hz
and above. However, we usually use it for the sonics at ?20-30Hz.

###Low frequency is used when the data includes only the means. Usually 10min mean, but it might also be 1min.

Maybe the names high and low are not accurate, and we should have used the names turbulence toolkit and meanWind
Changing it could be simply by adding a new name in the heraToolkitHome, without changing the actual names or we can change the names themselves
It won't matter to the user because he gets the toolkit through the map. so the old name could still be used.
